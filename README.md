<p><b>The Story:</b><br/>

i had the Idea after i returned from India where i had been traveling on Foot, Train and Motorbike from Goa to Kerala and back up to Dharamshala. 
  
Around March 2020 I was spending my time with new friends in Rishikesh, one of whom slowly got really sick, right when COVID really started in India.
We questioned bringing her to the Hospital but couldnt really tell, no doctors to find and the medicine shops gave us wrong or fake antibiotics, which didn't help.
So, during that time we had the need for a thermometer but couldn't find any after searching whole Tapovan.
Her condition worstened and nothing helped, so after a lot of convincing and back and forth, we brought her to the Rishikesh Hospital, masked up and evading the doctors in the entrances, who were to trying to catch and test all the "Covid Tourists".
We found out, after the usual India chaos, that she had a bladder infection that had started spreading to her kidneys. <br/>
She stayed in the hospital for 4 days, we visited. 
<br/>
<br/>
That gave me this idea, what if I could build a thing that had say, Body Temperature and HeartRate monitor, a Powerbank and a Lamp.
We definitely wouldn't have been so clueless and unaware of the danger that she had been in.
Our friend slowly got better with the help of antibiotics. Right after that, we decided to leave from Delhi for Germany with the last 
Government chartered ariplane, wich we almost missed. <br/>

Back in Germany i started planning. Very little know how about machining coding etc. but i'm getting there, slowly but surely. <br/>
Going through all the available arduino sensors and now looking into industrial sensors. <br/>
Getting into deep rabbitholes about for example thermal conductivity of aluminium vs copper variants or making up a crude 'operating system'. <br/>
Trying to add functionality into every last square mm while keeping it 'minimal' and robust. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>

You can see all the Planning, Prototypes and Material i made 'til now here: <br/>
